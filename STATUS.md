## What Works?

(From home-made 7.73 system tape)

* File 0 - TBOOT - loads and runs OK
* File 2 - DFMTR - seems to format and verify both type 6061 and type 6239 disks

## What's Next?

* File 3 - INSTL - seems to install Disk Bootstrap, ~~hangs~~ file not found trying to install System Bootstrap (File 4)
* File 1 - FIXUP - hangs during startup
