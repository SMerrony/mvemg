## What Works?

(From home-made 7.73 system tape image)

* File 0 - TBOOT - loads and runs OK
* File 2 - DFMTR - seems to format and verify both type 6061 and type 6239 disks
* File 3 - INSTL - appears to run to completion on 6061 type disk (29th April 2018)

## What's Next?

* Boot starter system from disk (!)
* File 1 - FIXUP - hangs during startup
